Hi, welcome to my homepage!

I'm a robotics software engineer with a strong interest in computer vision and artificial intelligence. I have several years of experience in the field of image processing and machine learning. Lately, I've been digging deeper into Visual SLAM and 3D reconstruction. I have several years of both professional and academic experience with C++ and Python and some experience with GPU programming with CUDA.

I hold a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from the [University of São Paulo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_São_Paulo) and I am currently finishing my master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [Technical University of Munich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_University_of_Munich). During my time at TUM, I focused extensively in the field of robotics, with a focus on computer vision for robotic perception.

Speaking broadly, my interests are in the following fields:

- Computer Vision
- Deep Learning
- Visual SLAM/3D Reconstruction
- GPU programming
